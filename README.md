# Fake News Detection #

This project implements an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning pipeline for detecting fake news articles. The workflow combines traditional text preprocessing, statistical feature extraction, unsupervised topic modeling, and supervised classification techniques to analyze and classify news content.

## Project Highlights

### **Data preprocessing & cleaning**
- Text normalization  
- Tokenization  
- Stopword removal  

### **Feature engineering**
- Bag-of-Words representation  
- TF-IDF vectorization  

### **Unsupervised topic modeling**
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  
- Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)  
- Coherence scoring for model evaluation  

### **Supervised machine learning**
- Logistic Regression classifier  
- Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM via SGDClassifier)  

### **Model evaluation**
- Train/test split  
- Classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)  
- Topic coherence analysis
